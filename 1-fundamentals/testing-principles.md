# Testing Principles

## Overview

Fundamental principles that guide effective software testing.

## Key Topics

- Testing shows presence of defects
- Exhaustive testing is impossible
- Early testing
- Defect clustering
- Pesticide paradox
- Testing is context dependent
- Absence of errors fallacy

## 1. Testing shows presence of defects

Testing can reveal bugs and issues in the software, proving that defects exist.

## 2. Exhaustive testing is impossible

You cannot test every possible scenario and input combination—impossible to achieve 100% coverage.

## 3. Early testing

Start testing during the early phases of development (requirements, design) rather than waiting for the final product.

## 4. Defect clustering

A small number of modules tend to contain the majority of defects; focus testing efforts on these high-risk areas.

## 5. Pesticide paradox

Running the same tests repeatedly will eventually stop finding new bugs; tests must be regularly updated and varied.

## 6. Testing is context dependent

Testing strategies and approaches vary based on the software type, industry, and specific project requirements.

## 7. Absence of errors fallacy

Even if testing finds no errors, it doesn't mean the software is fit for use; the software might not meet actual user needs.
