# Why Test?

## The Cost of Bugs

| Phase | Cost to Fix |
| --- | --- |
| Requirements | $100 |
| Design | $500 |
| Development | $1,000 |
| Testing | $5,000 |
| **Production** | **$100,000+** |

**Bottom line:** Testing is an investment that prevents catastrophic failures.

## 7 Reasons to Test

### 1. Risk Reduction

Identify problems before they harm users or damage the business.
Testing shifts risk from production to development.

### 2. Quality Assurance

Verify software works reliably across functionality, performance,
security, usability, and accessibility. Quality is measurable through
testing.

### 3. Cost Savings

Preventing defects is exponentially cheaper than fixing them in
production. Emergency fixes cost more in time, resources, and reputation.

### 4. User Satisfaction

Software that works reliably and meets actual user needs builds trust
and drives adoption. Users expect features to work without crashes.

### 5. Compliance

Many industries require documented testing evidence (healthcare, finance,
aviation). Compliance testing proves due diligence and protects from
liability.

### 6. Continuous Improvement

Testing reveals not just defects but usability issues, performance
bottlenecks, and architectural problems. This data drives product
improvement.

### 7. Informed Release Decisions

Stakeholders need objective evidence that software is ready: "95% of
tests pass, 8 low-priority defects deferred, performance acceptable."

## Remember

Testing is not quality control—it's **risk management**. Every test you
write prevents a potential production failure. Every defect you find saves
money and protects users.
