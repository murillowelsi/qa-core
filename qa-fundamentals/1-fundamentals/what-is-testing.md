# What is Testing?

## Definition

**Software testing** is the process of executing software to find defects
and validate it meets requirements.

## Core Activities

| Activity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Execution** | Run the software under controlled conditions |
| **Observation** | Watch what the software does |
| **Comparison** | Compare actual vs expected results |
| **Documentation** | Record what you found |

## What Testing is NOT

- ❌ Random clicking or casual exploration
- ❌ Only finding bugs (also verifies correct behavior)
- ❌ Debugging (that's fixing; testing is finding)
- ❌ Only the QA team's job (developers test too)

## Testing Objectives

1. **Find Defects** - Uncover bugs before users do
2. **Verify Requirements** - Confirm software does what it should
3. **Validate User Needs** - Ensure it solves real problems
4. **Assess Quality** - Decide if software is ready to release
5. **Reduce Risk** - Prevent costly production failures
6. **Build Confidence** - Prove quality to stakeholders

## Testing vs Debugging

| Aspect | Testing | Debugging |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Question** | "Is there a problem?" | "Why is there a problem?" |
| **Goal** | Find defects | Fix defects |
| **Output** | Bug reports | Code fixes |
| **Who** | QA, developers | Developers |

## The Testing Mindset

### Critical Thinking

Ask "what could go wrong?" rather than assuming everything works.

### Healthy Skepticism

Test assuming defects exist. Don't trust claims without evidence.

### Attention to Detail

Notice small inconsistencies: visual bugs, typos, edge cases.

### User Perspective

Test like a user would. Use real devices, real workflows, real data.

### Problem-Solving

Provide detailed reproduction steps, not just "it doesn't work."

## Key Distinctions

**Functional vs Non-Functional Testing:**

- Functional: Does it do what it should? (Features, workflows)
- Non-Functional: Does it work well? (Performance, security, usability)

**Validation vs Verification:**

- Verification: "Did we build it right?" (Tests, inspections)
- Validation: "Did we build the right thing?" (User needs)

## Summary

Testing is a systematic, intentional process to evaluate software
quality. It requires strategic thinking, curiosity, and attention to
